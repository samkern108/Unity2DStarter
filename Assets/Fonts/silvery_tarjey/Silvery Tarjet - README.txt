SILVERY TARJET
A Font by S. John Ross
Cumberland Games & Diversions

This is a simple font created for a simple personal project, but it has a nice kind of easy, legible warmth, drawing its base forms from classic typewriter glyphs and then dancing somewhere a bit three-dimensional with it, with stress (since I love stress ... on fonts, I mean).

SILVERY TARJET contains a complete U.S. keyboard set, ready to go. Enjoy!
